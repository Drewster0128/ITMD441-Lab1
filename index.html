                    My actual name is Andrew Cook, but, as you can tell from the title, I prefer to go by Drew. I am 23 years old and in the middle of my 5th year at IIT. I grew up in Tinley Park, a suburb south of Chicago. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, board games with my family, and keeping up with everything sports related.
