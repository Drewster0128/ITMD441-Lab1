                        My actual name is Andrew Cook, but, as you can tell from the title, I prefer to go by Drew. I am 23 years old and in the middle of my 5th year at IIT. I grew up in Tinley Park, a suburb south of Chicago. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, board games with my family, and keeping up with everything sports related.

                            I first coded in HTML and CSS in 2021 and have continued to practice it sparingly. Prior to this class, I have taken ITMD361 and ITM362. On my own time, I've coded in React as well.
